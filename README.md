# Parallelism
The notebook homework-4-parallelism.ipynb compares the performance of 3 parallelization methods - serial code, multi-processing with 4 codes and Ipcluster with 4 engines.<br>
The comparison is done by repeatedly running the monte-carlo simulation to calculate the value of \pi by throwing darts in a inside a unit square. <br>
The following plot was generated on Linux machine (Ubuntu) with i5-1.60GHz cores, 4 cores <br>
